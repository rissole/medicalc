# MediCalc
A program I made years ago for aninimouse of WoW-V.com. Medieval was a forum RPG that was pretty fun to play. It featured races, classes, spells, items, battles and more; come to think of it, it was very D&D like.

Anyway, this was a lot of work to maintain manually, so I volunteered to create a software solution to help him manage the forum RPG.

# Features:
* Provides graphical interfaces to manage players, classes, races, tradeskills, inventories, player spells, and battles
* Provides GUI-based battle 'simulator' with BBCode output to perform battle turns and provides output that can be posted on forums.

# Source
* Written in Visual Basic
* Uses SQLite database, requires some SQLite extension for VB
* Contains some nice, reusable controls in the Shared folder.
